    # are emitted from the stream until either the missing events are found or the timeout is reached
    # If the event is not found it is checked every `refresh-interval` so do not set this lower than that
    # if you want at least one retry
    # When looking for missing events only the current time bucket and the previous bucket are checked meaning that if
    # clocks are out of sync, or cassandra replication is out by more than your bucket size (minute, hour or day)
    # then the missing events won&#39;t be found
    gap-timeout = 10s

    # When a new persistenceId is found in an eventsByTag query that wasn&#39;t found in the initial offset scanning
    # period as it didn&#39;t have any events in the current time bucket, this is how long the stage will delay events
    # looking for any lower tag pid sequence nrs. 0s means that the found event is assumed to be the first.
    # The edge case is if events for a not previously seen persistenceId come out of order then if this is set to
    # 0s the newer event will be delivered and when the older event is found the stream will fail as events have
    # to be delivered in order.
    new-persistence-id-scan-timeout = 100ms

    # For offset queries that start in the current time bucket a period of scanning
    # takes place before deliverying events to look for the lowest sequence number

    # will have slightly different clocks meaning events aren&#39;t received in TimeUUID order in C*.
    # Keeping clocks in sync with ntp is not sufficient to prevent this as it only takes a milisecond.
    #
    # In addition events written from the same node in an unlogged batch, meant to be isolated in C*, have been

    # Another reason this is important is if the events are delivered to the
