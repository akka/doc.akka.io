<p>Just like any other Akka module, Akka HTTP is configured via <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config">Typesafe Config</a>. Usually this means that you provide an <code>application.conf</code> which contains all the application-specific settings that differ from the default ones provided by the reference configuration files from the individual Akka modules.</p>
<p>These are the relevant default configuration values for the Akka HTTP modules.</p>
